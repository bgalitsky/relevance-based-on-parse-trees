# 1. Introduction #
This component does text relevance assessment. It takes two portions of texts (phrases, sentences, paragraphs) and returns a similarity score.
Similarity component can be used on top of search to improve relevance, computing similarity score between a question and all search results (snippets).
Also, this component is useful for web mining of images, videos, forums, blogs, and other media with textual descriptions. Such applications as content generation
and filtering meaningless speech recognition results are included in the sample applications of this component.
> Relevance assessment is based on machine learning of syntactic parse trees (constituency trees, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree).
The similarity score is calculated as the size of all maximal common sub-trees for sentences from a pair of texts (

www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS10/paper/download/1146/1448).
> The objective of Similarity component is to give an application engineer as tool for text relevance which can be used as a black box, no need to understand
> computational linguistics or machine learning.

> 2.1 ) Get the source code / checkout from the repository
> 2.2 ) install models into
> > 2.2.1) From the root directory: cd src/test/resources
> > 2.2.1) Download VerbNet from
> > > http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/vn/verbnet-3.1.tar.gz
> > > and un-tar into new\_vn folder

> > 2.2.2) Download OpenNLP models from http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/
> > > into the folder /models (they need to be uncompressed).
> > > Please select the models for your natural language (English, German, Spanish etc)

> > 2.2.3) Download StanfordNLP models



> Please refer to OpenNLP installation instructions

> # 3. First use case of Similarity component: search #

> To start with this component, please refer to SearchResultsProcessorTest.java in package opennlp.tools.similarity.apps
> > public void testSearchOrder() runs web search using Bing API and improves search relevance.
> > Look at the code of
> > > public List

&lt;HitBase&gt;

 runSearch(String query)

> > and then at
> > > private	BingResponse calculateMatchScoreResortHits(BingResponse resp, String searchQuery)

> > which gets search results from Bing and re-ranks them based on computed similarity score.


> The main entry to Similarity component is
> > SentencePairMatchResult matchRes = sm.assessRelevance(snapshot, searchQuery);
> > where we pass the search query and the snapshot and obtain the similarity assessment structure which includes the similarity score.


> To run this test you need to obtain search API key from Bing at www.bing.com/developers/s/APIBasics.html and specify it in public class BingQueryRunner in
> protected static final String APP\_ID.

> # 4. Solving a unique problem: content generation #
> > To demonstrate the usability of Similarity component to tackle a problem which is hard to solve without a linguistic-based technology,
> > we introduce a content generation component:
> > > RelatedSentenceFinder.java


> The entry point here is the function call
> hits = f.generateContentAbout("Albert Einstein");
> which writes a biography of Albert Einstein by finding sentences on the web about various kinds of his activities (such as 'born', 'graduate', 'invented' etc.).
> The key here is to compute similarity between the seed expression like "Albert Einstein invented relativity theory" and search result like
> "Albert Einstein College of Medicine | Medical Education | Biomedical ...
> > www.einstein.yu.edu/Albert Einstein College of Medicine is one of the nation's premier institutions for medical education, ..."
> > and filter out irrelevant search results.


> This is done in function
> public HitBase augmentWithMinedSentencesAndVerifyRelevance(HitBase item, String originalSentence,
List

&lt;String&gt;

 sentsAll)
> > SentencePairMatchResult matchRes = sm.assessRelevance(pageSentence + " " + title, originalSentence);

> You can consult the results in gen.txt, where an essay on Einstein bio is written.

> These are examples of generated articles, given the article title

> # 5. Solving a high-importance problem: filtering out meaningless speech recognition results #
> > Speech recognitions SDKs usually produce a number of phrases as results, such as
> > "remember to buy milk tomorrow from trader joes",
"remember to buy milk tomorrow from 3 to jones"
> > One can see that the former is meaningful, and the latter is meaningless (although similar in terms of how it is pronounced).
> > We use web mining and Similarity component to detect a meaningful option (a mistake caused by trying to interpret meaningless
> > request by a query understanding system such as Siri for iPhone can be costly).


> SpeechRecognitionResultsProcessor.java does the job:
> public List

&lt;SentenceMeaningfullnessScore&gt;

 runSearchAndScoreMeaningfulness(List

&lt;String&gt;

 sents)
> re-ranks the phrases in the order of decrease of meaningfulness.

> # 6. Similarity component internals #
> > in the package   opennlp.tools.textsimilarity.chunker2matcher
> > ParserChunker2MatcherProcessor.java does parsing of two portions of text and matching the resultant parse trees to assess similarity between
> > these portions of text.
> > To run ParserChunker2MatcherProcessor
> > > private static String MODEL\_DIR = "resources/models";

> > needs to be specified


> The key function
> public SentencePairMatchResult assessRelevance(String para1, String para2)
> takes two portions of text and does similarity assessment by finding the set of all maximum common subtrees
> of the set of parse trees for each portion of text

> It splits paragraphs into sentences, parses them, obtained chunking information and produces grouped phrases (noun, evrn, prepositional etc.):
> public synchronized List<List

&lt;ParseTreeChunk&gt;

> formGroupedPhrasesFromChunksForPara(String para)

> and then attempts to find common subtrees:
> in ParseTreeMatcherDeterministic.java
List<List

&lt;ParseTreeChunk&gt;

> res = md.matchTwoSentencesGroupedChunksDeterministic(sent1GrpLst, sent2GrpLst)

> Phrase matching functionality is in package opennlp.tools.textsimilarity;
> ParseTreeMatcherDeterministic.java:
> Here's the key matching function which takes two phrases, aligns them and finds a set of maximum common sub-phrase
> public List

&lt;ParseTreeChunk&gt;

 generalizeTwoGroupedPhrasesDeterministic
